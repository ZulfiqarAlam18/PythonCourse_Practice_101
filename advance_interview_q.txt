What is a metaclass in Python, and how do you use it?
A metaclass is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves. You use it by defining a metaclass in the class definition using the metaclass keyword.

Explain the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its implications.
The GIL is a mutex that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, which can limit the performance of CPU-bound multi-threaded programs.

How does Python's memory management work?
Python uses reference counting and garbage collection (via the gc module) to manage memory. It automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation for objects.
What are Python descriptors and how do they work?

Descriptors are objects with methods __get__, __set__, and __delete__. They allow you to customize access to attributes and implement properties, methods, and static methods.
What is the difference between staticmethod and classmethod?

staticmethod does not receive an implicit first argument and is similar to a regular function. classmethod receives the class as the first argument and can modify class state.
What are Python decorators, and how do they work?

Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions or methods. They work by taking a function as an argument, extending its behavior, and returning a new function.
Explain the use of super() in Python.

super() is used to call a method from a parent class within a subclass. It helps in resolving the method resolution order (MRO) in multiple inheritance scenarios.
What is monkey patching in Python?

Monkey patching refers to modifying or extending code at runtime. It allows you to change or extend the behavior of libraries or classes without modifying their original code.
Explain the concept of generators and how they differ from iterators.

Generators are a type of iterator that use the yield statement to return values lazily, producing items one at a time as needed. They are more memory-efficient than regular iterators.
What are Python context managers, and how do you create one?

Context managers are used to manage resources (e.g., files) and ensure proper cleanup. They are created using the with statement and can be implemented using classes with __enter__ and __exit__ methods or with the contextlib module.
How does Python's garbage collector work?

Python's garbage collector uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to detect and clean up cyclic references. The gc module provides functions to interact with the garbage collector.
What is memoization and how is it implemented in Python?

Memoization is an optimization technique to cache the results of expensive function calls. In Python, it can be implemented using decorators or the functools.lru_cache decorator.
What is the difference between deepcopy and copy?

copy creates a shallow copy of an object, copying only the references. deepcopy creates a deep copy, copying the object and all nested objects recursively.
What are metaclasses, and how do you use them in Python?

Metaclasses control the creation of classes and their behavior. They are used by defining a __new__ or __init__ method in a class that inherits from type.
Explain the concept of duck typing in Python.

Duck typing is a concept where an object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the object's type itself.
How do you handle exceptions in Python?

Exceptions are handled using try, except, finally, and else blocks. You can catch specific exceptions or use a generic Exception.
What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__?

__str__ returns a human-readable string representation of an object, while __repr__ returns an unambiguous string representation for debugging.
What are Python's built-in data structures?

Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, strings, and frozensets.
How does Python implement method resolution order (MRO)?

Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the method resolution order in multiple inheritance. The MRO can be viewed using the __mro__ attribute or mro() method.
What is the purpose of the __slots__ declaration?

__slots__ is used to restrict the attributes that instances of a class can have, reducing memory usage and improving performance by preventing the creation of __dict__.
Explain the difference between mutable and immutable types.

Mutable types (e.g., lists, dictionaries) can be changed after creation, while immutable types (e.g., strings, tuples) cannot.
How do you manage dependencies in a Python project?

Dependencies are managed using pip and requirements.txt or tools like pipenv and Poetry to create isolated environments.
What are the different ways to create a dictionary in Python?

Using {}, dict(), dictionary comprehensions, or the fromkeys() method.
How can you optimize the performance of Python code?

Use built-in functions, list comprehensions, efficient algorithms, and libraries like NumPy. Profiling and using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers like PyPy can also help.
What is the difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__?

__getattr__ is called only when an attribute is not found, while __getattribute__ is called for every attribute access.
Explain the use of with statement and context managers in Python.

The with statement ensures proper acquisition and release of resources, simplifying resource management using context managers that implement __enter__ and __exit__.
What are Python's built-in functions for handling iterators?

Functions like iter(), next(), map(), filter(), zip(), reduce(), enumerate(), and sorted().
What is a mixin, and how do you use it in Python?

A mixin is a class that provides methods to other classes through multiple inheritance but is not intended to stand alone. Mixins are used to add reusable functionality to classes.
How do you implement caching in Python?

Caching can be implemented using the functools.lru_cache decorator or third-party libraries like cachetools or redis.
What is the purpose of the collections module?

The collections module provides specialized container datatypes like namedtuple, deque, Counter, OrderedDict, and defaultdict.
