What is Python?
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and ease of use.

What are Python’s key features?
Interpreted, dynamically typed, high-level, readable, and comprehensive standard library.

What is PEP 8?
PEP 8 is the Python Enhancement Proposal which provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code.

What is the difference between list and tuple?
Lists are mutable and can be changed after creation, whereas tuples are immutable.

How is memory managed in Python?
Python uses automatic garbage collection to manage memory.
What are Python decorators?
Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions or methods.

**What are *args and kwargs?
*args is used to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments, and **kwargs is used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments.

Explain the use of self in Python.
self represents the instance of the class and is used to access class variables and methods.

What is the difference between __init__ and __new__?
__init__ initializes a new instance of a class, while __new__ creates and returns a new instance.
What is a lambda function?

A lambda function is an anonymous function defined with the lambda keyword.
What is the difference between deepcopy and copy?

copy creates a shallow copy of an object, while deepcopy creates a deep copy of an object, including nested objects.
What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)?

The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes at once.
What are Python modules and packages?

Modules are individual Python files containing Python code, while packages are directories containing multiple modules.
What is list comprehension?

List comprehension provides a concise way to create lists using a single line of code.
What is the difference between range() and xrange()?

range() returns a list in Python 2 and an iterator in Python 3. xrange() returns an iterator in Python 2 (removed in Python 3).
What is the difference between is and ==?

is checks for object identity, while == checks for value equality.
Explain the use of with statement in Python.

The with statement is used to wrap the execution of a block of code within methods defined by a context manager, ensuring proper resource management.
What is a generator in Python?

Generators are iterators that yield items one at a time using the yield keyword.
What is the purpose of the __name__ variable in Python?

The __name__ variable allows you to check whether a module is being run directly or imported.
What are docstrings in Python?

Docstrings are string literals used to document modules, classes, functions, and methods.
What is a virtual environment?

A virtual environment is an isolated environment for Python projects, ensuring dependencies are separate.
How do you handle exceptions in Python?

Using try, except, finally, and else blocks.
What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod?

@staticmethod defines a static method that does not receive an implicit first argument, while @classmethod defines a method that receives the class as the first argument.
What is the difference between Python 2 and Python 3?

Python 3 is the latest version with several improvements over Python 2, including print as a function, Unicode support, and integer division.
What is a Python iterator?

An iterator is an object that implements the __iter__() and __next__() methods.
How can you optimize the performance of Python code?

Use built-in functions, list comprehensions, efficient algorithms, and libraries like NumPy.
What are Python’s built-in data types?

int, float, str, list, tuple, set, dict, and bool.
Explain the difference between remove(), del, and pop().

remove() removes the first matching value, del removes an item by index, and pop() removes and returns an item by index.
What is the purpose of pass in Python?

pass is a null operation used as a placeholder for future code.
How do you manage dependencies in a Python project?

Using pip and requirements.txt or tools like pipenv and Poetry.
What is a namespace in Python?

A namespace is a container that holds a set of identifiers and the objects they refer to.
How do you create a virtual environment in Python?

Using python -m venv <env_name>.
What is monkey patching in Python?

Monkey patching is dynamically modifying or extending a class or module at runtime.
What are Python’s built-in functions?

Examples include len(), max(), min(), sum(), sorted(), etc.
What is the difference between map(), filter(), and reduce()?

map() applies a function to all items in an iterable, filter() filters items based on a function, and reduce() applies a function cumulatively to items in an iterable.
What is the difference between join() and split()?

join() concatenates a list of strings into a single string with a separator, while split() splits a string into a list based on a separator.
What are Python magic methods?

Special methods with double underscores that define behavior for operators and built-in functions (e.g., __init__, __str__, __repr__).
What is the purpose of the glob module?

The glob module is used to find all the pathnames matching a specified pattern.
What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?

Shallow copy copies only the references to objects, while deep copy copies the objects themselves recursively.
How can you concatenate lists in Python?

Using the + operator or extend() method.
What is the use of enumerate() in Python?

enumerate() adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object.
How can you read and write files in Python?

Using the open() function with modes like 'r' for reading and 'w' for writing.
What is the difference between input() and raw_input()?

raw_input() reads input as a string in Python 2, while input() does the same in Python 3. In Python 2, input() evaluates the input as code.
What are Python sets and how are they used?

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements used for membership testing, removing duplicates, and set operations like union and intersection.
What is the use of zip() in Python?

zip() combines multiple iterables into a single iterator of tuples.
How do you install third-party packages in Python?

Using pip with the command pip install <package_name>.
What is list slicing and how is it used?

List slicing allows you to access a subset of a list using the syntax list[start:stop:step].
How do you handle dates and times in Python?

Using the datetime module.
What is the difference between mutable and immutable types?

Mutable types can be changed after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries), while immutable types cannot (e.g., strings, tuples).
What is the purpose of the re module?

The re module is used for working with regular expressions to match patterns in strings.
